    <h1>Current Trends in Deep Learning</h1>

    <p><i>Co-written by:<p1 style="color: green;">Eirik Folkesta</p1>, <p2 style="color: green;">Manu Gopinathan</p2> & <p3 style="color: green;">Øyvind Nygard</i></p3></p>
    <p> In the last decade, the area of artificial intelligence (AI) has exploded 
        with interesting <br>and promising results. With major achievements in image 
        recognition, speech recognition<br> and highly complex games, AI continues to 
        disrupt society. This blog post will discuss practical <br>applications of AI, optimization 
        and interpretability of deep learning models and <br>reinforcement learning (RL), based on the
        <u>2018 REWORK Deep Learning Summit</u>in Toronto. <br>Four software engineers from <u>Knowit</u> had the 
        pleasure of travelling to Canada to attend this conference, <br>and with renowned speakers such 
        as Geoff Hinton attending, it turned out be an insightful experience.</p>
    
    <h2>Practical Predictions and Applications of AI</h2>

    <p> Early AI revolved around perceiving, deciding and acting.<br> Today, the addition of learning
        is also in place, <br> but due to the non-deterministic nature of the real world, <br> decisions 
        cannot be made purely from the facts that are given. <br> Further development of AI will require 
        improvements <br> in a variety of areas. Andrew W. Moore, Dean of the School of <br> Computer Science 
        at Carnegie Mellon, shared his thoughts <br> on what he thinks will be important.</p>

    <p> Firstly, game theory provides an improvement to the <br> decision making capabilities of 
        an AI model, as the most <br> probable answer is not always the correct answer. This can 
        be explained <br> from his example of an AI trying to predict the whereabouts of poachers 
        in <br> a national park. At first, the AI performed well at predicting the location <br> of 
        poachers, however, after a while the poachers in the national <br> park learned from this and 
        went to less obvious locations. <br> As a result of this, the AI degenerated in performance. 
        To improve <br> the AI, game theory was introduced. By viewing the poachers <br> as other players in 
        a game, the AI was able to predict <br> where the poachers were located even though they were not 
        <br> necessarily located at the optimal locations.</p>
    
    <p> Secondly, autonomous AI is much researched these days. <br> This enables, e.g., smaller robots to 
        work together to solve <br> a larger problem, in addition self-optimizing code, <br> which means that 
        the efficiency of an algorithm <br> written by a human can be improved by an AI. These are only <br> a 
        few of the possibilities with more autonomous AI.</p>
    
    <p> As <u>presented</u> by Tzvi Aviv, Founder & CEO <br> at AgriLogicAI, AI can lead to major improvements 
        in <br> the agriculture and food sector. In his presentation he <br> showed that AI can be used in 
        conjunction <br> with geospatial data to increase productivity, profitability and <br> sustainability 
        in the agriculture and food sector. By using remote sensing <br> yield performance of soy 
        varieties, soil data, weather data <br> and genetic data of soy varieties, AgriLogicAi created an 
        Ensemble of <br> Cubist model, <u>a type of rule-based model</u>, model which projected <br> a 5% increase in 
        soy yields by optimizing the selected <br> soy variety given an area. This and other innovations to 
        the agricultural <br> food industry will become more and more important as we are <br> facing a difficult
        time ahead with more challenging weather conditions.</p>

    <p> Nargiz Mammadova, founder & CEO at <u>Destin AI</u>, <br> talked about the use of AI in immigration. To settle 
        down in a new <br> country you would have to fill out many forms and be approved for citizenship <br> through 
        various applications. Yet, before the actual <br> application process, you would have to navigate through
        the bureaucratic <br> process of identifying and localizing these applications. This is <br> where AI could be 
        helpful, exemplified by the AI <br> assistant Destin AI are currently working on, which can provide and 
        effective <br> interface for users to interact with. The involvement of RPA together with an <br> AI-powered 
        platform could potentially decrease refusal <br> rate and repetitive admin work, in addition to boosting 
        the efficiency and accuracy <br> of information to the user. Furthermore, it could increase the number of
        applications, <br> approval rate and the speed of the application process. Mammadova also presented <br> the
        possibility of predicting the outcome of <br> an application and identifying reasons for approval and 
        rejection. <br> As a result, the application reviewers can use more time on the <br> applications that are 
        difficult and require more time to assess.</p>

    <p> Brendan Frey, Co-Founder, CEO at Deep Genomics and Professor <br> at the University of Toronto, 
        provided an insight to AI <br> in the pharmaceutical industry. He pointed out that 65% of all 
        people will <br> be affected by a genetic disease over a lifetime and health budgets <br> in most 
        countries are extremely high. In combination with a rapidly decreasing <br>internal rate of 
        return for research and development in the pharmaceutical industry, the old way <br> of discovering 
        new drugs is broken. AI needs to be further explored <br> in this field and, as mentioned in his <u>paper</u>, 
        can most certainly help with this by aiding <br> in finding new drugs and personalize treatment
        according a person’s genome. <br> With the human genome mapped and the large amount of datasets 
        available, training <br> sequence models capable of discovering genes with unfavourable traits and 
        mutations is not far from reality.</p>

    <h2>Optimization and Robustness of Deep Learning</h2>

    <p> Another big topic in the future of AI is optimization of deep learning <br> 
        and how to make deep neural networks more robust. A known example of how <br>
        fragile neural networks can be, is this adversarial demonstration from <br> 
        <u>Explaining and Harvesting Adversarial Examples:</u></p>

        <img src="img2.webp" alt="panda" height="200" width="650">

    <p> In this example the network can detect the panda in the image to the left. <br>
        Now, if you alter that picture by adding a toned down image of noise with <br>
        gibbon-like features, the network will classify the image as a gibbon. However, <br>
        to the human eye the picture has not been altered at all.</p>

    <p> Researchers at McGill University are trying to address this by using Lipschitz <br> 
        regularization while performing adversarial training as presented at the REWORK <br>
        deep learning summit Toronto 2018. The Lipschitz constant measures the amplification <br>
        factor of a perturbation, and by adding this to the loss function during training of <br>
        a neural network, one can improve the adversarial attack robustness with a significant amount.</p>

    <p> Another challenge for AI is processing power. In the future we want the machine learning <br>
        models to run on embedded devices such as phones and in cars, but the amount of processing <br>
        power currently present in these devices are not on the same level as computers. Snapchat <br>
        uses neural networks in their filters, and are working on making these networks runnable on your <br>
        phone. One way Snapchat is trying to solve this issue is by model compression; how can we keep <br>
        the high accuracy, but lower the computational complexity? Their idea is to use weight sampling, <br>
        as convolutional filters are, in their words, highly redundant. Snapchat has developed new features, <br>
        allowing 5x3 (15) weights be condensed to 7 weights, thereby reducing the memory usage by more than 50%.</p>

    <p> The University of Guelph (UoG) are also working on deep learning optimization. ML practitioners often <br>
        assume they have a 32-bit floating point data type easily accessible. However, by using lower precision <br>
        one can greatly increase speed and memory advantages. Researchers from UoG are working on methods <br>
        to train networks with binary weights and activations at run time. In addition to memory advantages <br>
        and higher speed, they report that the binary networks are also more resistant to adversarial attacks!</p>
